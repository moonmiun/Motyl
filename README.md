# Motyl-web-service
<br> **Work in progress** of my Scientific Programming project (Politecnico di Milano).
<br>
<br> Motyl aims to be a Web Service built for researching, storing, editing and comparing informations about Transcription Factors binding motifs. The informations are taken from JASPAR - a database of transcription factors binding profiles (https://jaspar.elixir.no/) and, through Motyl, it is possible to create and manage a personal database.
<br> The Web service can currently be used in two ways:
- Interactively through Powershell or any kind of terminal;
- Interactively through your Browser, with a personalised, user-friendly interface.

<br> Currently working on (08/07/2024):
<br> - Automate the process so it can be implemented into automatic pipelines.
<br>
<br> The project is expected to be completed not later December 2024. for curricular reasons.
